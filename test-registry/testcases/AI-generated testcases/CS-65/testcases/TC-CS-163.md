### Test Steps

| Step | Action | Test Data | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to the SAP Fiori Launchpad URL in the browser | `{ENV.SAP_FIORI_URL}` | SAP IDP login page is displayed with an email/username field |
| 2 | Enter the user email address in the email field | `{ENV.SAP_USERNAME}` | Email address is entered |
| 3 | Click the "Continue" button | — | Page transitions to the password entry screen |
| 4 | Enter the user password in the password field | `{ENV.SAP_PASSWORD}` | Password is entered (masked) |
| 5 | Click the "Continue" button | — | SAP authenticates the user and redirects to the Fiori Launchpad home page |
| 6 | If an Introduction / Welcome pop-up appears, close it | — | Pop-up is dismissed; Fiori home page with application tiles is fully visible |
| 7 | Click the search icon (top-right shell bar) and type "Manage Bills of Material" | — | Search results appear listing the "Manage Bills of Material" application |
| 8 | Click "Manage Bills of Material" from the search results | — | "Manage Bills of Material" application opens displaying the BOM list screen |
| 9 | Click the "Create" button in the application toolbar | — | New BOM creation form opens in edit mode |
| 10 | In the "Material" header field, enter the finished product material number | `{TD.finishedProductMaterial}` | Finished product material number is entered into the field |
| 11 | Press Enter to confirm the Material entry | — | SAP validates the material; material description `{TD.finishedProductDesc}` is auto-populated |
| 12 | In the "Plant" header field, enter the plant code | `{TD.plant}` | Plant code is entered into the field |
| 13 | Press Enter to confirm the Plant entry | — | SAP validates the plant; plant description `{TD.plantDesc}` is auto-populated |
| 14 | In the "BOM Usage" field, select the usage type | `{TD.bomUsage}` | BOM Usage is set to "Production" |
| 15 | In the "Valid From" date field, enter the validity start date | `{TD.validFromDate}` | Valid From date is populated with the specified date |
| 16 | In the "Items" section, click the "Create" button (below the Items table) | — | A new empty line item row appears in the Items table |
| 17 | In the "Component" field of the line item, enter the component material number | `{TD.componentMaterial1}` | Component material number is entered into the field |
| 18 | Press Enter to confirm the Component entry | — | SAP validates the material; material description `{TD.componentDesc1}` is auto-populated |
| 19 | Leave the "Quantity" field of the line item blank (do not enter any value) | — | Quantity field remains empty |
| 20 | In the "UoM" field, verify or enter the unit of measure | `{TD.componentUoM1}` | UoM is populated (auto-filled from material master or entered manually) |
| 21 | Click the "Save" button in the toolbar | — | SAP begins validation; an error message is displayed |
| 22 | Observe the error message content | — | Error message indicates "Component Quantity" is a required field in the line item and must be entered; the field is highlighted in red or marked with an error indicator |
| 23 | Verify that the BOM is not saved | — | BOM is not persisted; user remains in the BOM creation form with the error message visible |
| 24 | Click the "Cancel" or "Discard" button to exit the BOM creation form | — | Confirmation dialog appears asking to discard unsaved changes |
| 25 | Confirm discard action | — | BOM creation form is closed; no BOM is created; user returns to the BOM list screen |
| 26 | Click the User Profile icon (top-right of the Fiori shell bar) | — | User profile menu appears |
| 27 | Click "Sign Out" | — | Sign out confirmation dialog appears |
| 28 | In the Sign Out dialog, click "OK" | — | User is signed out; SAP login page is displayed |

---

### Expected Final Result

- SAP detects the missing "Component Quantity" field in the line item during save validation
- An error message is displayed: "Component Quantity is a required field" or similar
- The Quantity field is highlighted with an error indicator
- The BOM cannot be saved without a valid component quantity in the line item (AC-1 enforcement)
- No BOM is created or persisted in the system
- User is prevented from saving the BOM until the Component Quantity field is populated

---

### Post-conditions

- No new BOM record exists in SAP
- No change history entry is created
- System validation for mandatory Component Quantity field (AC-1) is successfully enforced
- No application-level errors or critical warnings remain outstanding after discard action
