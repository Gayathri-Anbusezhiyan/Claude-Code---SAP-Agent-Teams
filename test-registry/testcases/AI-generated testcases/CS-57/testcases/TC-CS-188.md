### Expected Final Result

- System accepts the minimum valid Standard Duration value (0.01) without validation error
- A unique Master Recipe ID is generated by SAP and displayed in the recipe header
- The recipe is persisted in SAP with status "Draft"
- All header data and operation data including Standard Duration (minimum boundary) is correctly stored
- Boundary value testing confirms that the lower limit of the time duration range is properly validated and accepted

---

### Post-conditions

- SAP Master Recipe document exists with the generated Recipe ID
- Recipe status is "Draft"
- Operation data including Standard Duration is stored as 0.01 (minimum valid value)
- No application-level errors or critical warnings remain outstanding
