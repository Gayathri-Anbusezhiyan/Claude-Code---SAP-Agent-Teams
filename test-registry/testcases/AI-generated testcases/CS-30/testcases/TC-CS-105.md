### Test Steps

| Step | Action | Test Data | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to the SAP Fiori Launchpad URL in the browser | `{ENV.SAP_FIORI_URL}` | SAP IDP login page is displayed with an email/username field |
| 2 | Enter the user email address in the email field | `{ENV.SAP_USERNAME}` | Email address is entered |
| 3 | Click the "Continue" button | — | Page transitions to the password entry screen |
| 4 | Enter the user password in the password field | `{ENV.SAP_PASSWORD}` | Password is entered (masked) |
| 5 | Click the "Continue" button | — | SAP authenticates the user and redirects to the Fiori Launchpad home page |
| 6 | If an Introduction / Welcome pop-up appears, close it | — | Pop-up is dismissed; Fiori home page with application tiles is fully visible |
| 7 | Click the search icon in the top-right shell bar | — | Search input field appears |
| 8 | Type "Manage Material Master" in the search field | — | Search results appear listing the "Manage Material Master" application |
| 9 | Click the "Manage Material Master" application from the search results | — | The Manage Material Master application opens |
| 10 | Click the "Create" button in the application toolbar | — | Material Master creation form opens with General Data view |
| 11 | In the "Material Type" field, select the material type | `{TD.materialType}` | Material type is populated |
| 12 | In the "Material Description" field, enter the material description | `{TD.materialDescription}` | Material description is entered |
| 13 | In the "Base Unit of Measure" field, select the unit | `{TD.baseUoM}` | Base unit of measure is populated |
| 14 | Locate the "Batch Management" checkbox and check it | `{TD.batchIndicator}` | Batch Management checkbox is checked |
| 15 | Navigate to the "Plant Data / Storage" view by clicking the corresponding tab or section | — | Plant Data / Storage view is displayed |
| 16 | In the "Plant" field, enter or select the plant code | `{TD.plant}` | Plant code is populated |
| 17 | Leave the "Total Shelf Life" field empty (do NOT enter any value) | `{TD.emptyValue}` | Total Shelf Life field remains empty |
| 18 | In the "Minimum Remaining Shelf Life" field, enter the minimum shelf life value in days | `{TD.minRemainingShelfLife}` | Minimum Remaining Shelf Life value is entered |
| 19 | Navigate to the "Quality Management" view by clicking the corresponding tab or section | — | Quality Management view is displayed |
| 20 | In the "QM Inspection Type" field, select the inspection type | `{TD.qmInspectionType}` | QM Inspection Type is populated |
| 21 | Click the "Save" button in the application toolbar | — | SAP detects the missing mandatory field |
| 22 | Observe the error message or field validation indicator | — | System displays mandatory field error: "Total Shelf Life is required" or highlights the field with red border/icon indicating mandatory field missing; save action is prevented |
| 23 | Verify that the material record was NOT saved | — | No material number is generated; form remains in edit mode |
| 24 | Click the User Profile icon in the top-right of the Fiori shell bar | — | User profile menu appears |
| 25 | Click "Sign Out" | — | Sign out confirmation dialog appears |
| 26 | In the Sign Out dialog, click "OK" | — | User is signed out; SAP login page is displayed |

### Expected Final Result

- SAP system detects the missing Total Shelf Life mandatory field and prevents material creation
- System displays clear mandatory field error message or visual indicator (red border, error icon, error text)
- Error message specifies "Total Shelf Life is required" or similar field-specific message
- No material number is generated
- Material record is NOT persisted in SAP database
- Form remains in edit mode allowing user to correct the missing field
- AC-3 (mandatory field enforcement for shelf-life parameters) is validated

---

### Post-conditions

- No new Material Master record exists in SAP
- System correctly enforces mandatory field validation for Total Shelf Life on Plant Data/Storage view
- User is informed of the missing field and can correct the error
- No partial or incomplete material record is created
